# MongoDB CSFLE Companion Projects

This repository contains companion projects to go along with our [CSFLE Use Case Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide/). These companion projects
are structured so that they bundle all requirements except for `mongocryptd`,
which is available for download from the [MongoDB Download Site](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise).

For the Java implementation, see the `java` directory.

For the Python implementation, see the `python` directory.

For the Node.js implementation, see the `nodejs` directory.
